# OCSC-Character-Analysis
Analysing stem cell characteristics in high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) organoid transcriptomes after 6 days in vitro.

Tumor samples were collected from 4 patients with HGSOC. RNA-sequencing was performed immediately after extraction and again after 6 days of in vitro culturing.
Here, we investigate how well the in vitro samples retain the stem-like characteristics seen in the initial samples.
To do this, we perform DEA and GSEA, with visualisations using PCA, heatmap, and volcano plots.
